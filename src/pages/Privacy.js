For California Citizens – Your Rights and Choices
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.  
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE EXERCISE OF YOUR RIGHTS DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE ARE A “COVERED BUSINESS” UNDER THE CCPA.  CURRENTLY WE ARE NOT A COVERED BUSINESS.  WE WILL HONOR YOUR RIGHTS BELOW WHEN WE BECOME A COVERED BUSINESS.
CA’s Right to Know and Data Portability
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months (the "right to know"). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will disclose to you:
The categories of personal information we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).
CA’s Right to Delete 
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions (the "right to delete"). Once we receive your request and confirm your, we will review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: 
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Your CA’s Right to Know and Delete
To exercise your rights to know or delete described above, please submit a request by either: 
Calling us at 1 (844) 200-8332.
Emailing us at info@onsiteplanning.com
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know or delete related to your personal information.  You may also make a request to know or delete on behalf of your child. 
You (or your guardian acting on your behalf) may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. The request to know or delete must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include your or your parent’s legally authorized driver’s license or passport.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. 
You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know or delete. 
We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make it. 
Response Timing and Format
We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact info@onsiteplanning.com.
We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. 
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. 
You can review and change your personal information by logging into Onsite and visiting your account profile page.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of Onsite, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. 
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to Onsite. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Onsite.
